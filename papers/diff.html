    <h1>Notes</h1>
      <h2>My own footnotes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Since our work so far is not including implementation of a difficulty curve or DDA so far, this work is not seem related to ours.</li>
          <li>However, after detecting the difficulties of our levels, this can definitely be considered.</li>
          <li>The difficulty is defined vaguely in the paper, and this definition requires a user study.</li>
        </ol>
      <h2>A brief summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The work is on the measurement of difficulty and using DDA(Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) with respect to player's skills.</li>
          <li>Difficulty is defcined as probability of losing, given a player and a level.</li>
          <li>They created their own shooting game and 10 different levels with different difficulties that are differing with number of enemies and the skill it takes to kill them.</li>
          <li>After, they have conducted a user study to test their study.</li>
        </ul>
