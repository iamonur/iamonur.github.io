            Introduction
            <ul>
              <li>Traditional game design: Iterative manner. Design, play-test, get feedback, repeat.</li>
              <li>Purpose of the work is to automate this cycle without human testers.</li>
              <li>All parameters in game creates another dimension. This high-dimensional space is called game space. All points in game space are unique designs.</li>
              <li>The reason of game choice is to have less parameters to tune.</li>
              <li>Score probability distribution is a nice to have since it is both quantitative and easy to analyze.</li>
              <li>Survival analysis provides a well-defined hazard rate.</li>

            Flappy Bird Game Space
            <ul>
              <li>Measured difficulty h(x) is probabilty of fail, given that score x is already reached. Called hazard rate.</li>
              <li>
                Even a simple game like Flappy Bird has lots of parameters:
                <ol>
                  <li>World height</li>
                  <li>Pipe gap location range: vertical distance between lower pipe in the obstacle before and upper pipe in next.</li>
                  <li>Pipe gap</li>
                  <li>Pipe seperation</li>
                  <li>Pipe width</li>
                  <li>Gravity</li>
                  <li>Bird size</li>
                  <li>Bird velocity</li>
                  <li>Bird jump velocity</li>
                </ol>

                Player Precision
                <ul>
                  <li>This is how you deviate when you plan to press a button.</li>
                  <li>Standard deviation here is minimum 35.9 ms to 61.1 ms</li>
                  <li>When a button needs to be pressed at time T, they press it in t+€, where € is a random that is pulled from a normal distribution with 0 mean and the given standard deviation.</li>
                  <li>stdev=0 tests if level is playable, =35.9 is an expert player, =61.1 is a novice player</li>

                Actions Per Second and Reaction Time
                <ul>
                  <li>A person should have 7.7 actions in a second at maximum.</li>
                  <li>When a change happens on the screen, it takes 288 ms to react, like a person.</li>

            Survival Analysis
            <ul>
              <li>f(x) is the probability distribution function. This is the probability of getting x as points in the game.</li>
              <li>S(x) is surviving through point greater or equal to x.</li>
              <li>Hazard function is h(x)=f(x)/S(x)</li>
              <li>If h(x) = undefined, game is unwinnable</li>
