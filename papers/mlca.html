            Introduction
            <ul>
              <li>It is hard to choose a model for ML, and the success depends on it. This is mostly done via experience.</li>
              <li>CCA both takes advantage of the MCS, and the self-organizing abilities of CA.</li>
              <li>In CCA, multiple ML approaches are implemented.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple Classifier Systems
            <ul>
              <li>Also known as ensembles, or committees.</li>
              <li>Since each classifier has some weak sides, combining them should improve the performance.</li>
              <li>One of the most popular: Bootstrap Aggregation - Bagging and Boosting.</li>
              <li>Bagging: Replicates training set and trains agents alone. Final classification is done by a majority vote.</li>
              <li>Boosting: Combines classifiers with weighted voting. Distribution of training set is done adaptively.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Cellular Automata
            <ul>
              <li>CA are both simple and models complex systems.</li>
              <li>Spatially extended decentralized system made up of individual cells.</li>
              <li>Each cell is in a specific state that changes each step.</li>
              <li>
                CA as a MCS Model
                <ul>
                  <li>MCS models are either work on combination, or perturbation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li>
            Classificational Cellular Automata
            <ul>
              <li>CCA is presented as a classifier.</li>
              <li>Each cell can contain a classifier, and a state according to its classification of an input sample. This state can be same as the sample's class, a different class, or a "cannot be classified.".</li>
              <li>
                The learning algorithm:
                <ul>
                  <li>Input: Learning set with N learning samples</li>
                  <li>Number of iterations: t=1,...T</li>
                  <li>For t=1,2,...T:</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Choose a learning sample I</li>
                  <li>Each cell in the automaton classifies I</li>
                  <li>Change cells' energies according to transaction rules</li>
                  <li>If energy of a cell is below zero -> It is dead.</li>
                  <li>Fill dead cells with random new ones.</li>
                </ol>
                Energy of the cell is reflecting succesfulness of classification. Each neighborhood cell influences the energy of the current cell. score = support.confidence.distance; eqScore = sum of scores of all neighbors that has the same classification; noClassScore = sum of scores of neighbors that cannot clasify.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If a cell has the same classification as the sample class:
                    <ul>
                      <li>If noClassScore > 0: e += ( 100 - eqScore * 100 / noClassScore )</li>
                      <li>Else: e += 400</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a cell differs from sample class:
                    <ul>
                      <li>If noClassScore > 0: e -= ( 100 - eqScore * 100 / noClassScore )</li>
                      <li>Else: e -= 100</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a cell cannot clasify the sample: e -= 10
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Inference algorithm:
                <ul>
                  <li>Input: A sample for classification</li>
                  <li>Number of iterations: t=1,2,...V</li>
                  <li>
                    For t=1,2,...V:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Each cell in automaton classifies.</li>
                      <li>Change energies of cells.</li>
                      <li>Cells with negative energy will die.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Classify the sample with weighted voting of surviving cells.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
