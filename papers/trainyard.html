      <h2>A brief summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Trainyard is a transport puzzle game. Here is a video down below:</li>

            <li>Here's the whole pipeline of them:</li>

            <li>Level Generator:
              <ul>
                <li>Mission Generator: Determines the stations and trains to be used by color and count.</li>
                <li>Grid Placement: Makes sure that every station is reachable by the corresponding train. However, this is not enough to say the level is solvable.</li>
                <li>Here is how the level generator works:</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Level Solver: Truly checks if a level is solvable by trying one-by-one. If it is solvable, records the easiest solution of it. Here's how level solver works:</li>

            <li>Difficulty Estimation: Difficulty is tied up to 5 different factors listed below(All weights are calculated from a user study):
              <ol>
                <li>Stations(weighted 0.1601): Number of stations increase difficulty.</li>
                <li>Trains(weighted 0.1126): Difference between start and end number of trains increase difficulty.</li>
                <li>Colors(weighted 0.2194): Symmetric difference between the start and the end colors mean switching should be made for every time and this increases difficulty.</li>
                <li>Tracks(weighted 0.4267): Number of switches in the simplest solution increases difficulty.</li>
                <li>Grid(weighted 0.1177): Empty grid space to be worked on to solve the level increases difficulty.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
