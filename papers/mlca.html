            Introduction
            <ul>
              <li>It is hard to choose a model for ML, and the success depends on it. This is mostly done via experience.</li>
              <li>CCA both takes advantage of the MCS, and the self-organizing abilities of CA.</li>
              <li>In CCA, multiple ML approaches are implemented.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple Classifier Systems
            <ul>
              <li>Also known as ensembles, or committees.</li>
              <li>Since each classifier has some weak sides, combining them should improve the performance.</li>
              <li>One of the most popular: Bootstrap Aggregation - Bagging and Boosting.</li>
              <li>Bagging: Replicates training set and trains agents alone. Final classification is done by a majority vote.</li>
              <li>Boosting: Combines classifiers with weighted voting. Distribution of training set is done adaptively.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Cellular Automata
            <ul>
              <li>CA are both simple and models complex systems.</li>
              <li>Spatially extended decentralized system made up of individual cells.</li>
              <li>Each cell is in a specific state that changes each step.</li>
              <li>
                CA as a MCS Model
                <ul>
                  <li>MCS models are either work on combination, or perturbation.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Classificational Cellular Automata
            <ul>
              <li>CCA is presented as a classifier.</li>
              <li>Each cell can contain a classifier, and a state according to its classification of an input sample. This state can be same as the sample's class, a different class, or a "cannot be classified.".</li>
