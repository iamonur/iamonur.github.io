            Abstract
            <ul>
              <li>Rehabilitation games should be nicely integrated in stations, adhere constraints of clinical protocols, involve goal-oriented movements, and adapt patient's current progress.</li>
              <li>Current games rarely adapt to patient's condition.</li>
              <li>A new station is developed that employs a fuzzy system to monitor the exercises, according to medical constraints, that provides feedback to the patients.</li>
            </ul>

            Introduction
            <ul>
              <li>Commercial motion-sensing game controllers have huge potential in rehabilitation.</li>
              <li>Rehabilitation games designed for these should be adjustable for patient and therapy goals.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            A Hierarchical Platform for Rehabilitation at Home
            <ul>
              <li>IGER: Intelligent Game Engine for Rehabilitation.</li>
              <li>The goal of the project is low-cost game-oriented platform that can be used in home.</li>
              <li>Platform includes a patient station, hospital station, and a networking station (PS, HS, NS)</li>

            The Game System
            <ul>
              <li>Two components: Game engine and the game control unit.</li>
              <li><b>Game engine:</b> Gaming functionalities.</li>
              <li><b>Game control unit:</b> Matches needs of games for rehabilitation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fuzzy-Based Monitoring
            <ul>
              <li>There are 4 different function for all parameters: OK, risky, bad, wrong. Total of these 4 in any point will be equal to 1.</li>
              <img src="img/fuzzy-1.png"></img>
              <li>From these functions, 5 different severity(alarm) levels are computated:Silent, Log, Warning, Error, and Shotdown. Also total of these in any point is 1.</li>
              <img src="img/fuzzy-2.png"></img>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bayesian-Based in-Game Adaptation
            <ul>
              <li>The adequacy of the actual game parameters can be inferred by measuring the hit ratio inside the game.</li>
              <li>This ratio can be associated with the subjective difficulty of the game for a given patient.</li>
              <li>2 different algorithms are implemented for DDA.</li>
              <li>First depends on performance of the patient in one repetition. Before game starts, the n game parameters can be adapted, and a target performance is set. After the repetition, real performance is computed from the hit ratio.
                <ul>
                  <li>If P_r > P_d, difficulty is increased.</li>
                  <li>If P_r < P_d, difficulty is reduced.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Second is built upon Quest Bayesian method. Works real-time. It is not level-based, it is trial-based. Each trial is either a pass or hit (binary). To adapt safely, define PDF of parameter x, f(x).
                3 assumptions:
                <ol>
                  <li>Performance function always have the same shape</li>
                  <li>Patient threshold should not vary between trials</li>
                  <li>Individual trials are statistically independent.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                  <li>Quest function is: <b>Q(x) = f_x(x)*f_D|x(D|x) = f_x(x)*( PI ( p_ri|x(x_i), i=1 to n))</b>.</li>
                  <li>Also we can develop cannonical function <b>PHI(x_i - x) = p_x(x_i)</b>.</li>
                  <li>With the help of cannonical function, we can develop success and failure functions: <b>S(x_i) = PHI(-x_i), F(x_i) = 1 - PHI(-x_i)</b>.</li>
                  <li>That makes the QUEST function: <b>Q_i(x) = Q_(i-1)(x) * S(x - x_i)[IF SUCCESS] Q_i(x) = Q_(i-1)(x) * F(x - x_i)[IF FAILURE]</b>.</li>
                </ul>
                Also, as the PDF, Weibull function is selected.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            A Self-Adaptive Rehabilitation Game
            <ul>
              <li>Fruit catcher is a Kinect game.</li>
              <li>Can be used in two different rehabilitation scenarios: Weight Shifting and Stepping.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
