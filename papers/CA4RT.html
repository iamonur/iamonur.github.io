            Abstract
            <ul>
              <li>Uses cellular automata for PCG since it is computationally efficient. Thus, CA can run real-time.</li>

            Introduction
            <ul>
              <li>Some kind of games require real-time generation of levels (ie rogue-like ones.)</li>
              <li>Since CA-PCG is inexhaustable, levels become less predictable.</li>
              <li>If PCG is used in level generation, levels become parameterazible.</li>
              <li>Also, PCG can be used as a guidline for human level-designers.</li>
            </ul>

            Background
            <ol>
              <li>
                One common algorithm is Mid-point Displacement:
                <ul>
                  <li>It's easy to implement and computationally efficient.</li>
                  <li>
                    It is highly indirect
                    <ul>
                      <li>Only parameter it takes is a random seed.</li>
                      <li>It is not controllable, so it is not a good approach for PCG.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Another one is Search-Based PCG(SBPCG):
                <ul>
                  <li>Consumes lots of computational power.</li>
                  <li>Highly controllable.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                CA for PCG:
                <ul>
                  <li>This is the first example of it in academy. From what I see, it is both controllable enough and computationally efficient.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            CA-PCG Approach
            <ul>
              <li>Initial grid is called base.</li>
              <li>4 neighbors for basic CA, 8 for advanced. Also you can increase it to 24, for 2 unit distance; or 48 for 3 unit distance, etc.</li>
              <li>
                This is how the generation works
                <ol>
                  <li>Initialize the level empty.</li>
                  <li>Change r% of the level to rock(R=50 by default.)</li>
                  <li>
                    Iterate Cellular Automata n times.
                    <ol>
                      <li>Calculate "Neighborhood Value" for every cell</<li>
                      <li>If NV is less than T (T=5 by default), make this cell a "floor"</li>
                      <li>Else, makes this cell a rock.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Draw a wall around rocks.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Given the same parameter set(random seed, r, n, T, and M(Moore Neighborhood Size)), the same level can be reconstructed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Maps with different parameters are presented are presented in the paper.
